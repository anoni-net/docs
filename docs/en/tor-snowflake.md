# :simple-snowflake: Tor Snowflake Bridges (WebRTC)

Directly create a Tor bridge through a web page by simply enabling it in one step, which can help establish onion connections for those unable to connect via traditional Tor methods.

## Enable Snowflake Bridge

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   <iframe src="https://snowflake.torproject.org/embed.html" width="100%" height="250" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>

-   
    - Please directly click the "Enable" button.
    - This page can run in the background of a tab.
    - If it doesn't work properly after activation, please check if the WebRTC feature is enabled; theoretically, browsers that support video conferencing should be compatible.
    - You can install it via a browser extension; please refer to the [official page](https://snowflake.torproject.org/){target="_blank"} for more information.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is Snowflake?

Tor Snowflake is a bridge technology used in the Tor network that helps users bypass internet censorship. It enables temporarily peer-to-peer connections through the use of WebRTC communication by volunteers worldwide, allowing blocked or restricted users to access websites and services that have been blocked.

### How does Snowflake work?

Snowflake uses a technology called WebRTC, which is commonly employed in video conferencing software. It masks your Tor usage by making it appear as though you are on an audio or video call, thereby helping to bypass network censorship.

### Can I use a browser extension to circumvent censorship?

If you want to circumvent censorship, you need to download a Tor-powered application, such as Tor Browser or Orbot. If the application cannot connect and it seems that the connection is still blocked, you can go to the application's settings and enable Snowflake to help unblock the connection.
