## :fontawesome-solid-users-gear: Preparation Team

This time, we will have a one-day track to conduct the workshop. Although COSCUP has not yet announced which day we'll be assigned, it does not affect the pre-workshop preparations. We will continue with the format of the workshop hosted by the [Tor and OONI teams in February 2025](./blog/posts/rightscon25-pre-event.md), with the only difference being localized adjustments and conducting it in Chinese.
Currently, we need the following roles, each of which can be cross-participatory. You only need to have basic skills, and there will be training activities to enhance them.

## Round-Table

<figure markdown="span">
  ![schedule](./assets/images/event_workshop_2025_schedule.svg)
  <figcaption>The proposed itinerary for the two event days. </figcaption>
</figure>

We successfully secured a two-day schedule for this event. The workshop is planned for the first day (09, Aug.) from 12:30 PM to 3:30 PM. The remaining time on the first day, as well as the entire second day, will be conducted in a round-table format. We will discuss topics related to **anonymous networks**, **internet censorship**, and **open-source tools**. We have preliminarily planned three main categories with six discussion topics, covering current status, technology, and community collaboration. The target participants are members from the news media, independent journalists, civic groups, and the open-source technology community. The aim is to discover issues and reach consensus on solutions through discussion.

Each round-table discussion is expected to have no more than 25 participants. We'll assign 1 to 2 facilitators and 1 note-taker per session.

Before the event, we will invite those who are interested in the topics or roles to become facilitators. If you, or someone you recommend, are interested, please [let us know](./contact.md) so we can send an invitation and get them involved in the discussion!

??? tip "Roles and Functions"

    - **Facilitator**: Responsible for leading the meeting and ensuring the agenda proceeds as planned. The facilitator manages the pace of the discussion, maintains time management, and ensures that every participant has the opportunity to speak. They promote effective communication to achieve the meeting's objectives.
    - **Participants**: Actively engage in discussions, sharing their perspectives and opinions, and contributing constructively to the decision-making process. Through brainstorming, they aim to identify the best solutions or resolutions.
    - **Note-taker**: Records key points, decisions, and action items discussed during the meeting in detail. They are responsible for organizing and distributing the meeting notes to relevant parties post-meeting, providing accurate records for follow-up and implementation.
    - **Observers** (optional): Attend the meeting to evaluate the topics and processes, but they do not actively participate in the discussion or decision-making. They offer independent perspectives for post-meeting reflection or improvement suggestions.
    - **Experts or Consultants** (optional): Provide expert opinions and technical knowledge, offering actionable advice on specific issues or topics. They assist decision-makers in making more precise and effective decisions in technical or specialized areas.

### Proposed Discussion Topics

Currently, we have initially planned three main categories with six discussion topics. These may be adjusted when facilitators join, or the discussion may follow the topics set by the facilitators.

??? abstract "Intersection of Open-Source Technology and Anonymous Tools"

    #### "The Open-Source foundation and Local Participation Possibilities of Tor/Tails/OONI"

    - How do these tools operate? What free software and open-source protocols do they adopt?
    - In what aspects can Taiwanese developers or cybersecurity researchers participate? (e.g., translation, bug reporting, creating tutorials)
    - How can we reduce the "technical distance" to encourage more people to contribute?

    #### "From User to Contributor: How Taiwan Can Establish Community Nodes and Feedback Models for Tor/OONI"

    - Does Taiwan have foundational nodes like Tor relays or OONI Probe? How are they functioning?
    - What are the practical technical, administrative, and legal challenges? (e.g., hosting costs, blockages, legal concerns)
    - Can we operate and mentor newcomers through a community approach?

??? abstract "Social Connection between Open-Source Spirit and Internet Freedom"

    #### "Free Software and Digital Rights: Why Is Open Source Key to Anonymous Tools?"

    - Why is open source important for journalists and civic groups? How can trust in these tools be established?
    - Explore core values such as "verifiability," "censorship resistance," and "community governance."
    - Open-source vs. closed commercial cybersecurity tools: How should we choose?

    #### "How to Localize an Open-Source Anonymous Toolkit?"

    - From everyday browsing (Tor) to operating systems (Tails) and internet monitoring (OONI), what other open-source tools can be included?
    - What does the toolkit look like? (e.g., Live USB image, local language packs, manuals)
    - Launching a "Taiwan version" of a simplified kit (suitable for NGOs, journalists, beginners)

??? abstract "Local Community and Collaborative Practices"

    #### "Promoting a Decentralized, Open-Source Collaborative Anonymous Network Initiative"

    - How can we delegate tasks if we use a civic tech community and open-source community collaboration model?
    - Can we establish an "Open-Source Maintenance Team" (working group model) to maintain Tor/OONI servers and regularly test ISP blocking conditions?
    - What non-technical roles (e.g., design, translation, instructors, writers) can participate?

    #### "Potential for Regional Open-Source Collaboration: Connecting with Other Anonymous Network Communities in Asia"

    - In regions like Southeast Asia, Hong Kong, China, Japan, and South Korea, there are similar open-source anonymous projects or promotion teams.
    - Can cross-border collaboration be established? For example, collaborating on the translation of OONI test results or co-authoring educational materials.
    - Can Taiwan become a connection hub? (Given its security, freedom of speech, and technical community presence)
