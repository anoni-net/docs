# Anonymity Network Community

In the rapidly evolving digital age, the internet has become an indispensable part of our lives. However, with the widespread adoption of the internet, personal privacy and online freedom are facing unprecedented challenges. In Taiwan, we aim to promote the concepts of "**anonymous networks**" and "**internet freedom**" to raise public awareness of these critical issues.

We plan to use open-source anonymous tools like Tor, Tails, and OONI to enhance anonymity and security online. We hope that **news media**, **independent journalists**, **civil society groups**, and the **open-source technology community** will have more opportunities for collaboration and exchange. Together, we seek to explore and develop corresponding solutions to enhance our ability to protect privacy and expand the scope of international cooperation. This will give us the opportunity to jointly participate on the international stage in defending online privacy and freedom of expression.
