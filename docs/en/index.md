# OONI-Research

This project primarily assists the OONI local community's research. We will regularly organize data and monitor the current state of internet freedom in Taiwan through ASN comparison queries, organizing the OONI tested websites list, and promoting localization and maintaining the Chinese version of OONI.

OONI (Open Observatory of Network Interference) is a project focused on observing internet censorship. Volunteers around the world help execute the monitoring applications, detect blockages, and report their findings back to the organization. The [Open Culture Foundation](https://ocf.tw/){target="_blank"} (OCF), as one of OONI's [community partners](https://ooni.org/partners/open-culture-foundation/){target="_blank"}, assists in advocating for regional internet censorship issues and promoting the installation of OONI's monitoring software.
