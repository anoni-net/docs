# :material-hand-heart: How to Participate and Choose a Theme

## Three Themes for 2026

- **Personal Privacy Guidelines**: Write and organize actionable privacy guides (scenario → tools → steps).
- **Tor Relay on Campus**: Document the process of applying for campus Tor relays, design activities, and promote on campus.
- **Anonymous Payments**: Conduct research on the topic, clarify regulations, and share practical experience.

For full background and context, see: [Continuing from 2025 into 2026](../../blog/posts/2025to2026.md).

## How to Choose and Take Ownership

You can join at any time. Please share which theme you’re interested in on **Matrix**:

- Post in the room corresponding to your chosen theme
- This helps with later grouping and collaboration and lets others know who is working on what

We recommend first joining the community **Public Space**, which gives you entry points to all related rooms at once. See [Communication and Collaboration Tools](communication-tools.md) for details.

## How to Participate Day to Day

- **Everyday discussions**: Use **Matrix rooms** as the main space. Themes can have their own dedicated rooms as needed.
- **Collaborative writing**: Use **Cryptpad** for shared notes, activity minutes, or sensitive content.
- **Online meetings**: Use **Jitsi** for regular or topic-focused meetings; links are usually shared in Matrix rooms.

Next step: If you haven’t used these tools before, please first read [Communication and Collaboration Tools](communication-tools.md) (account application, entry URLs, Public Space link).
