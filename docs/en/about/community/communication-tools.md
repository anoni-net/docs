# :material-message-text: Communication and Collaboration Tools

For day-to-day work, our community uses **Matrix** for discussion, **Cryptpad** for encrypted collaborative documents, and **Jitsi** for online meetings. Below are the entry points, usage patterns, and how to request accounts.

## Matrix (Real-time Discussion)

- **Purpose**: Everyday discussion, expressing interest in themes, coordination within theme rooms
- **Homeserver**: `im.anoni.net`
    - **Web (Element)**: [https://matrix.anoni.net/](https://matrix.anoni.net/){target="_blank"}
    - **Apps (Element X)**: [Download the apps](https://element.io/download) and set the homeserver to `im.anoni.net` after installation.
    !!! note "Additional note"

        If you already have a `matrix.org` account, you can continue using it. Element, whether on the web or as an app, works across the Matrix federation as long as the homeserver is configured correctly.

- **Account request**: Currently, Matrix accounts on `im.anoni.net` are created on request. Please email <whisper@anoni.net>; we will reply with instructions and important notes.
- **Recommended first step**: Join the community **[Public Space](https://matrix.to/#/#community:im.anoni.net)** to get entry points to the relevant rooms in one go.
- **How to join**: After your account is ready, open the Space link in Element, or join individual rooms as needed.

## Cryptpad (Encrypted Collaboration)

- **Purpose**: Shared notes, co-editing workshop material, and collaborating on sensitive content
- **Entry point**: Community Cryptpad [homepage](https://cryptpad.anoni.net/)
- **Account request**: Cryptpad accounts are also created on request. Please email <whisper@anoni.net>. We currently offer 50 MB of storage by default and may adjust this later.
- **How to use**: After you have an account, create new pads, share links, and set permissions (view only / can edit). Links to shared notes for events are usually posted in Matrix.

## Jitsi (Online Meetings)

- **Purpose**: Online meetings (theme discussions, regular sync meetings)
- **Service**: [https://jitsi.goodmeet.asia/](https://jitsi.goodmeet.asia/){target="_blank"} (free to use, hosted by a third party and not self-hosted).
- **How to use**: Open the link, create or enter a room name, and share the meeting link (usually posted in Matrix rooms).
