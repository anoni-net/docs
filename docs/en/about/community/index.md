# :material-account-group: Community Participation

We focus on **anonymous networks**, and use tools such as Tor, Tails, and OONI to promote internet freedom and privacy in Taiwan. In 2026 we are focusing on three main themes. You are welcome to pick one and join the discussion and collaboration.

## Three Themes for 2026

- **Personal Privacy Guidelines**: Compile practical privacy protection guides, with tools and steps for different situations (everyday, sensitive work, high-risk contexts).
- **Tor Relay on Campus**: Work with EFF and the Tor Project to promote campus relay nodes. We already have a successful case at NTNU and aim to document the application process and outreach activities.
- **Anonymous Payments**: Explore anonymous payment methods beyond cash (e.g., stablecoins, blockchain-based tools), including both regulatory and practical aspects.

For detailed background and planning, see: [Continuing from 2025 into 2026: Personal Privacy Guidelines, Tor Relay Campus Deployment Competition, and Exploration of Anonymous Payments](../../blog/posts/2025to2026.md).
