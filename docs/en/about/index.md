# :material-account-box-outline: About Us

We are a group focused on "Anonymous Networks" and "Internet Freedom," aiming to raise public awareness about the importance of internet freedom through tools like Tor, Tails, and OONI. We are currently recruiting community members to establish our initial group of partners, with hopes to regularly share and update on the status of "Anonymous Networks" online.

At the start of our project, we concentrated solely on the OONI project, by examining the completeness of observational data for Taiwanese ASNs in the OONI database and whether it reflects Taiwan's current internet status. As we continued to promote OONI, we found that Taiwan enjoys relatively more internet freedom, with fewer occurrences of international issues. Consequently, it is challenging to find real-life cases related to internet monitoring or interference in Taiwan to support promotion efforts. Therefore, we decided to shift our focus and role, concentrating on privacy-related issues and promoting and establishing anonymous network services with a focus on "Anonymous Networks."

Our primary mission is to successfully conduct the "Anonymous Network Workshop" scheduled for August 2025. We hope to recruit our first group of community partners through this workshop to collaboratively plan the goals and structure for the community in 2026!
