## :fontawesome-solid-users-gear: Preparation Team

This time, we will have a one-day track to conduct the workshop. Although COSCUP has not yet announced which day we'll be assigned, it does not affect the pre-workshop preparations. We will continue with the format of the workshop hosted by the [Tor and OONI teams in February 2025](./blog/posts/rightscon25-pre-event.md), with the only difference being localized adjustments and conducting it in Chinese.
Currently, we need the following roles, each of which can be cross-participatory. You only need to have basic skills, and there will be training activities to enhance them.
