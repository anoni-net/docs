In an environment where digital surveillance and internet censorship are increasingly pervasive, **journalists**, **civil society groups**, and **human rights advocates** are facing unprecedented information risks: communications may be intercepted, identities tracked, and the safety of interviewees threatened. In such times, we need to reclaim control over our communications, rather than just relying on platforms.

> _:shield: When press freedom encounters surveillance and censorship, when advocacy actions are monitored and voices suppressed—how can we continue to safely express ourselves and protect human rights and freedoms?_

- Date: August 9 (Sat) and August 10 (Sun), 2025
- Location: Room TR-510, Yan-Yang Teaching Building, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology（國立臺灣科技大學 研揚教學大樓 TR-510 教室）
- Conference format: Workshop and roundtable discussions

This workshop will be supported and guided by the local open-source community "[Anonymous Network Community anoni.net](https://anoni.net/en/){target="_blank"}," introducing open-source anonymous network tools such as Tor, Tails, and [OONI](./what-is-ooni.md){target="_blank"}. It will assist participants in setting up secondary secure devices, establishing anonymous connections, and conducting network censorship detection, thereby enhancing the digital resilience of their movements and advocacy efforts. Let's work together to implement the infrastructure for information freedom, using technology to safeguard truth and resist oppression.

### Roundtable Discussions

In addition to the workshop activities, we would like to take this opportunity to explore the potential for collaboration between **news media**, **independent journalists**, **civil society groups**, and the **open-source technology community**. We also invite everyone to discuss their vision for the future of the "Anonymous Network Community." We aim to find ways to provide assistance, whether in terms of technical support or resource coordination. Hopefully, through this roundtable discussion, we can discover more possibilities!
