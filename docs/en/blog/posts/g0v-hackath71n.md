# Project Proposal – g0v Hackath71n (g0v, the 71st Hackathon)

![g0v hackath71n / g0v the 71st Hackathon](https://assets.anoni.net/blog/g0v-hackath71n.webp)

This time, we’re heading south to [Kaohsiung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaohsiung){target="_blank"} (a.k.a. Takao) to participate in the “[g0v Hackath71n – g0v the 71st Hackathon](https://jothon.g0v.tw/){target="_blank"}.”
If you happen to be in southern Taiwan during this period, or if you’d like to travel south to Kaohsiung together—**combining a short trip with a few days of remote work** while joining the event—feel free to come find us at the hackathon. We’ve registered a booth to help move forward the progress of the “Anonymous Online Community” [2026](./2025to2026.md) project!

At the moment, it looks like there are still a few spots available. If you’re interested in our project and would like to contribute, you’re very welcome to join us on the day of the event—**no matter your background or area of expertise**.

- **Time:** January 25, 2026 (Sun) 10:30–17:30 (+0800)
- **Location:** [Le Phare Co-working Space | Xin Zuoying Branch](https://lephare.maison-life.tw/about-xinzuoying/) / **4F, Global Mall, No. 1, Zhanqian North Road, Zuoying District, Kaohsiung City, Taiwan**

## Hackathon Goals

The January 25 hackathon will focus on advancing :simple-readdotcv:{style="color: green;"} :simple-readdotcv:{style="color: brown;"} :simple-readdotcv:{style="color: purple;"} three project goals:

- :simple-readdotcv:{style="color: green;"} **Personal Privacy Guidelines**:
  How can we make practical adjustments to improve the security of our everyday internet usage? At present, we still lack a complete, actionable set of guidelines and materials.`(Curriculum development)`

- :simple-readdotcv:{style="color: brown;"} **Tor Relay Campus Deployment Competition**:
  There is already a successful example at National Taiwan Normal University. To enable students at other universities to follow suit, we need a clear, well-documented process covering communication with schools, applications, and ongoing maintenance.`(Event planning)`

- :simple-readdotcv:{style="color: purple;"} **Anonymous Payments**:
  As an essential piece of the “anonymity” puzzle, how anonymity can be achieved in everyday payment scenarios is a direction we plan to explore in greater depth.`(Topic research)`
