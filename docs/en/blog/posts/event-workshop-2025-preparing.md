# Recruiting Staff and Training Helpers for the "Anonymous Network Workshop"

![Anonymous Network Workshop Tor, Tails, OONI](./assets/images/event-workshop-2025.png){style="border-radius: 10px;box-shadow:1px 1px 0.6rem #00aeff;"}

This year, we have applied for a track at COSCUP and secured an opportunity to host a workshop. We are now starting to recruit event preparation staff and training course helpers. If you are interested in topics like **internet freedom, internet censorship, internet surveillance, anonymous networks**, etc., and willing to dedicate some time over the next three months (until 2025/08) to help us prepare and organize this workshop, please refer to the instructions on the [event page](../../event-workshop-2025.md) for more details!

The format of the workshop will follow the style of the workshop hosted by the [Tor and OONI teams in 2025/02](./rightscon25-pre-event.md), with the only difference being localized adjustments and conducted in Chinese.
