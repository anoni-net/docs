# 2025/04 Project Status and Updates

Long time no see. April was a very busy period, and the OONI-Research project progressed a bit slowly. We translated an update released by OONI: [Launch: New OONI Explorer thematic censorship pages](https://ooni-research.ocf.tw/docs/blog/2025/04/2025-ooni-explorer-thematic-censorship-pages/). Additionally, our translation of the "[Tor University Challenge](https://toruniversity.eff.org/zh-tw/)" for eff.org has been completed and successfully updated on their website. However, we currently lack the energy to promote this program, so perhaps we can brainstorm on how to push it forward.

Most importantly, we have started preparing for the "[Anonymous Network Workshop](../../event-workshop-2025.md)" scheduled for 2025/08!

## Recruiting Staff and Training Helpers for the "Anonymous Network Workshop"

We plan to host the "[Anonymous Network Workshop](../../event-workshop-2025.md)" at this year's COSCUP 2025 conference, continuing from [the workshop held before RightsCon](./rightscon25-pre-event.md). This time, we will focus on translating and localizing the teaching materials and conduct the sessions in Mandarin. Before the event in 2025/08, we will provide training for helpers on Tor/Tails, and OONI, enabling them to lead participants more effectively on the day of the workshop to understand the importance of anonymous networks and internet freedom.

Over the next three months, we also need event planning staff to assist with coordination, promotion, registration, notifications, and other event-related tasks. We welcome shy newcomers to join us in organizing the event and gradually get to know us and the issues of anonymous networks and internet freedom.

We have set up an event page for the workshop, where the preparation tasks, schedule, and future registration will be presented. This workshop primarily targets participants from news media, independent journalists, civic groups, and the tech community. It aims to provide them with reference tools or solutions when facing severe issues related to internet freedom in their daily work.

We also hope to enhance the knowledge of those interested in Tor/Tails and OONI through this workshop! We designed a skill grading chart, and our future training hopes to elevate everyone to **Basic Level 3**!
