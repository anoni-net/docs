# 2025/06 Project Update: Anonymous Network Workshop Registration Open

![Anonymous Network Workshop Progress Update](./assets/images/post-update.png){style="border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 1px 1px 0.6rem #00aeff;"}

June 2025 has passed, and this month we continued our preparations for the workshop event scheduled for August. We've also conducted online training sessions focusing on the basics of Tor/Tails and OONI. The "[Anonymous Network Workshop](../../event-workshop-2025.md){target="_blank"}" event information has been fully updated, with the two-day event agenda and registration form now completed. Registration is now open!

In addition, we have moved the project to the "[Anoni.net Community](https://anoni.net/en/){target="_blank"}" [GitHub](https://github.com/anoni-net){target="_blank"} page. The original OONI-Research project page will automatically redirect to the new domain, serving as a promotional tool for the "anonymous network" alongside Tor/Tails.

    :material-head-question: Although the internet in Taiwan is very free!

The primary goal of the anonymity network community is to establish Taiwan as a base. We aim to raise public awareness about "**Why are anonymous networks and internet freedom important?**" Through promotion and advocacy, we hope to recruit like-minded partners to join our community. As we continue to strengthen our capabilities, we will start providing technical support and assistance tailored to the needs and contexts of news media, independent journalists, and civil society organizations.

    :material-head-question: The internet in Taiwan is very free; perhaps we can do something to help our neighbors, countries, and regions around us!

Therefore, if you happen to be available on August 9th and 10th, we invite you to join our workshop. This time, we have also arranged several roundtable discussions, providing an opportunity to hear your thoughts and visions about "anonymous networks."

Feel free to share our [event information](../../event-workshop-2025.md){target="_blank"} with friends who might be interested in "anonymous networks."
