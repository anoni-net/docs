# Community Project Establishment - Anonymity Network Community

![Anonymity Network Community Anoni.net](https://images.anoni.net/og_home.png){style="border-radius: 10px;box-shadow:1px 1px 0.6rem #00aeff;"}

We initially focused solely on observing and analyzing [OONI](../../what-is-ooni.md){target="_blank"} data. Now, we are jointly promoting Tor/Tails anonymous network tools, deciding to use the topic of "**anonymous networks**" to continue advocating for "**internet freedom**" in Taiwan.

Thanks to this workshop event, we have been fortunate to gather partners from various backgrounds to join our community. We hope to maintain this diversity in the future, focusing on and providing diverse assistance to the people we serve.

- Community Name: **Anonymity Network Community**
- Community Website: [https://anoni.net/](https://anoni.net/){target="_blank"}

The original [OONI-Research](https://ooni-research.ocf.tw/){target="_blank"} website will automatically redirect to [https://anoni.net/docs/](https://anoni.net/docs/){target="_blank"}. We plan to host a meeting after the "[Anonymous Network Workshop](../../event-workshop-2025.md){target="_blank"}" to discuss our visions for the community's future. If interested, you can continue to [follow us](../../contact.md){target="_blank"} or [subscribe](https://form.anoni.net/s/w21855zpca072rvgp0s2govj){target="_blank"} to our newsletter.

Thank you!
