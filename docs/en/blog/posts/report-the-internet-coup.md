# Report: The Internet Coup

![](https://assets.anoni.net/the-internet-coup/The-Internet-Coup-InterSecLab-2048x986.png){style="border-radius:10px;"}

In mid-September, you may have noticed something significant: approximately 500GB of data was [made public](https://gfw.report/blog/geedge_and_mesa_leak/en/){target="_blank"}. This data pertains to [China's Great Firewall (GFW)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Firewall){target="_blank"} technology and how this system is exported and implemented in other authoritarian regimes.

[InterSecLab](https://interseclab.org/){target="_blank"}, a digital security-focused laboratory, became aware of this leaked data around December 2024 and promptly took action. Over the course of 10 months, they collaborated with several organizations and tech communities to verify and analyze the leaked data. The findings were published in a report released on September 12, 2025.

Although we (Anonymous Network Community) did not assist in the initial stages, after the report was released, we quickly reviewed its content. The report confirmed many of the long-suspected capabilities of the Great Firewall. Furthermore, the report provided a clearer picture of the teams and organizations operating behind the scenes. Their development environment is similar to that of modern startup teams, with operations and maintenance for international deployments being remotely executable. In other words, the Chinese Communist Party government and other client countries can activate customized or general rules with a single click!

## Details

For more detailed information about the leaked data and the operational aspects of China's Great Firewall, you can refer to the report we have translated into [Mandarin](https://anoni.net/docs/report/interseclab-the-internet-coup/){target="_blank"} (Taiwanese terminology, zh-TW). The layout of this translated report follows the INDEX section from the original report, presented as chapters (a total of eight chapters). We hope that this format will allow you to easily cross-reference with the sections in the original report while reading.

## Acknowledgments

Finally, we would like to thank **Marla Rivera** from InterSecLab for accepting our proposal to participate in the translation process and for the subsequent encouragement. This report has provided us with a clearer understanding of the risks posed by China. Once again, thank you!

## Next Steps

We have opened a discussion channel regarding this report. If you have any thoughts after reading, feel free to join the discussion and share with us. InterSecLab plans to hold a follow-up discussion meeting about the report. If you're interested in participating, please let us know via email, and we will facilitate sending out an invitation from InterSecLab.

Additionally, InterSecLab intends to further explore the leaked data's code. If you're interested in joining the "Review Code" activities, you can directly contact InterSecLab to express your interest in participating.
