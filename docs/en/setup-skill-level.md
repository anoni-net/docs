        ??? question "Understand what Tor is."

            You can start by exploring the "[What is Tor?](https://support.torproject.org/about/what-is-tor/){target="_blank"}" section to gain an understanding.

            Tor typically refers to "The Onion Router," which relays network connections randomly through three nodes. The "Tor Browser" is designed by the Tor team using the open-source browser Firefox to facilitate accessing websites ending in .onion via the onion network.

            :octicons-question-24: **Additional Information**

            1. **Background of Tor**: Tor was originally developed by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory with the aim of protecting government communications. It was later made available to the public to support freedom of speech and privacy protection.
            2. **How it works**: Tor's name derives from its routing techniqueâ€”The Onion Router. It encrypts your internet traffic and relays it through multiple nodes, making it difficult to trace.
            3. **Privacy and security advantages**: Using Tor can prevent network monitoring and traffic analysis, serving as a vital tool for privacy protection. Consequently, Tor can circumvent geo-blocking and internet censorship, allowing for freer exploration of information online.
            4. **Disadvantages and limitations**: While Tor offers strong privacy protection, its speed is usually slower than traditional internet connections due to the multiple layers of encryption and nodes. Using Tor does not guarantee complete anonymity; users may still be identifiable if they inadvertently reveal personal information or log into service accounts.
            5. **Legal and ethical considerations**: In some countries or regions, using Tor may be considered illegal or inappropriate, and users should understand local laws to avoid legal issues. There are also illegal activities on the onion network, so users should remain vigilant when browsing.
            6. **Usage tips**: When using Tor, avoid enabling unnecessary plugins, scripts, or downloading untrusted content, as these actions may reveal your real IP address or expose you to security risks.

        ??? question "Understand why internet freedom is important, and what anonymous networks are."

            You can begin by exploring the "[Why Internet Freedom Matters?](./internet-freedom-matter.md){target="_blank"}" section to gain an understanding.

            :octicons-question-24: **Additional Information**

            Taiwan's internet is generally free, but there are severe differences in the level of internet control in the neighboring countries.

            1. **The Importance of Internet Freedom**: Internet freedom involves issues of **freedom of speech**, **information flow**, and **privacy rights**. A free internet allows people to exchange ideas, access information, and express opinions without restrictions, which is crucial for democratic and innovative development. In some countries, strict internet control may lead governments to block websites, restrict social media, and monitor personal traffic, affecting not only basic human rights but also limiting informational diversity and transparency.
            2. **What is an Anonymous Network**: An anonymous network is a technology that allows users to browse the internet while hiding their identities to protect their privacy and security. These networks typically rely on multi-layer encryption and routing technologies, such as Tor's Onion Routing, making users' traffic difficult to trace. Anonymous networks can serve as a safe haven for users in complex political environments, particularly those wishing to circumvent censorship or protect sensitive information.
            3. **Advantages and Risks of Anonymous Networks**: Using an anonymous network can protect privacy and help users bypass internet censorship, access blocked websites, and communicate with a broader audience. However, anonymous networks are also used for some illegal activities, which may attract the attention and intervention of legal authorities. Thus, while gaining anonymity and freedom, users must understand and bear the associated risks.

        ??? question "Is the internet in Taiwan free?"

            Do you think the internet in Taiwan is free? As we reflect on this, we might consider comparative events or reference materials.

            :octicons-question-24: **Additional Information**

            1. **International Rankings and Reports**: According to the annual reports from "Freedom House," Taiwan is generally rated as one of the countries with high internet freedom. This report evaluates global countries on openness of internet access, freedom of speech, and user rights protection. Taiwanese netizens can freely access most international websites and express diverse political viewpoints online, which might face restrictions or risks in some neighboring countries.
            2. **Comparative Events**: In contrast, China employs the "Great Firewall" technology to comprehensively block various international sites like Google, Facebook, and Twitter/X, conducting internet censorship. Since the implementation of the National Security Law, Hong Kong's internet freedom has also been affected, with some websites being blocked. These situations highlight Taiwan's prominence in internet freedom.
            3. **Local Events and Policies**: In Taiwan, while internet freedom of speech is highly secured, challenges such as **fake news** and **cyberbullying** remain, pushing the government and civil organizations to actively seek legal and technical improvements. Regarding internet surveillance, the government may require telecommunications providers to cooperate by providing user information when necessary for investigations, but most of these actions are legally constrained to protect citizens' privacy rights.
            4. **Reference Data**: According to evaluations by multiple international organizations, Taiwan scores high on internet freedom indices. These evaluations are based on the severity of internet censorship, surveillance measures, freedom of speech, and the legal system.

    - [x] Understand how Tor browser connects.
    - [x] Types of Tor bridges: Bridge, Snowflake, WebTunnel.
    - [x] Use cases and timing for each connection.
    - [x] Can you connect to Tor via VPN?

    !!! abstract "Tor: Basic L2"

        ??? question "Understand how Tor browser connects."

            The "[Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/zh-TW/download/){target="_blank"}" is designed by the Tor team using the open-source [Firefox ESR](https://www.mozilla.org/zh-TW/firefox/enterprise/){target="_blank"}, a long-term support version, tailored for the onion network to facilitate accessing websites ending in .onion. Currently, both [Brave](https://brave.com/zh-tw/){target="_blank"} and [Mullvad](https://mullvad.net/zh-hant/browser){target="_blank"} browsers can be used to connect to .onion websites.

            The Tor Browser is similar to regular browsers but emphasizes **privacy protection** and effectively blocks **ad tracking**. When connecting to regular websites (non-.onion URLs), data is randomly transmitted through three Tor relays. For .onion websites, a connection enters the .onion network after the third relay.

            :octicons-question-24: **Additional Information**

            1. **Anonymous Browsing**: The Tor Browser is primarily designed to protect user privacy. When you browse the internet with Tor, your traffic passes through a series of randomly selected relay servers, undergoing multiple layers of encryption and routing. This ensures that any entity trying to track the origin can only see the IPs of virtual relays, not your actual IP address. Thus, Tor effectively prevents websites and service providers from logging or tracking your IP address and browsing behavior, enhancing user anonymity.
            2. **Circumventing Censorship**: In some countries or regions, governments may enforce internet censorship, restricting user access to certain websites or services. The Tor Browser helps users bypass these blocks since its traffic is relayed through servers in multiple countries, complicating recognition and blocking by surveillance and filtering systems. This allows users to freely access content banned by local network administrators or governments, enjoying a more liberated internet environment.
            3. **Security Protection**: Tor Browser uses multi-layer encryption technology and onion routing to enhance network security, particularly when using public Wi-Fi or other insecure network environments. Each layer of transmission is encrypted, only decrypted upon entering and exiting the Tor network. Each relay server only sees incoming and outgoing data to the directly adjacent servers, preventing knowledge of the full transmission path or final destination. This effectively reduces the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks while protecting user data from theft or tampering.
            4. **Temporary Access**: One-time usage design of the Tor Browser ensures that user privacy is thoroughly protected after each session. When you close the Tor Browser, all browsing history, cookies, login information, and other temporary cache data are automatically cleared, preventing others from viewing your browsing activity and safeguarding personal data against unauthorized access.
            5. **Open Source**: Tor's open-source nature means its code is publicly available, allowing developers and security experts to review and fix potential vulnerabilities, enhancing overall security. Open-source community collaboration enables Tor to be continuously updated, addressing emerging security threats and attracting developers worldwide to cooperate, contributing to the enhancement of privacy protection.

        ??? question "Types of Tor bridges: Bridge, Snowflake, WebTunnel."

            In the Tor network, bridge servers exist to help users facing internet censorship or blocks connect to Tor. Below are different types of Tor Bridges:

            1. **Bridge**: This is the most basic type of Tor bridge. Bridges serve as secret entry points not listed on the public Tor network, making them harder to block. Users can manually obtain these bridges to connect to the Tor network and bypass common blocking measures. (Refer to how to obtain a [Tor Bridge](https://bridges.torproject.org/){target="_blank"})
            2. **Snowflake**: This type of bridge is specifically designed to counter high-intensity internet censorship. Snowflake employs the WebRTC protocol, allowing volunteers to use their browsers as temporary Tor entry points. Due to its dynamic nature, it is more challenging to block. This bridge can automatically connect and offer more random entry points, further enhancing connectivity reliability. (Refer to how to install [Snowflake](https://snowflake.torproject.org/){target="_blank"})
            3. **WebTunnel**: This is a newer technology designed to tackle more complex blocking strategies. WebTunnel uses HTTPS servers as entry points to mitigate the issue of traditional bridges being blocked. Since it uses the HTTPS protocol, WebTunnel traffic is difficult to distinguish and block, thereby increasing the chances of bypassing censorship. (Refer to how to set up a [WebTunnel](https://community.torproject.org/relay/setup/webtunnel/){target="_blank"})

        ??? question "Use cases and timing for each connection."

            1. **Bridge**:
                  - **Use Case**: You are in an environment with basic Tor blocking, such as certain schools, workplaces, or internet cafes that restrict access to Tor.
                  - **When to Use**: Suitable for situations requiring simple circumvention of mild blocking. You can first attempt a basic Bridge, which is usually sufficient to bypass most IP-based blockings. You can obtain the latest bridge host list from the official Tor website or other sources.
            2. **Snowflake**:
                  - **Use Case**: Facing severe censorship in countries like China and Iran, where deep packet inspection (DPI) and IP blocking are commonly used to prevent Tor traffic.
                  - **When to Use**: When Bridges are unable to bypass censorship or when you need a more randomized connection to avoid detection and blocking, Snowflake is a better choice. Snowflake utilizes WebRTC (a technology that enables browsers and devices to connect directly without a middle server) for more randomized and decentralized connections, supported by global volunteers, thereby improving the connection success rate.
            3. **WebTunnel**:
                  - **Use Case**: When your network not only blocks Tor entries but also has advanced traffic monitoring mechanisms capable of quickly identifying and blocking Snowflake.
                  - **When to Use**: When encountering extreme blocking strategies and other bridge types fail, try WebTunnel. Its HTTPS disguise can more effectively hide Tor traffic within regular internet traffic, such as accessing HTTPS websites, making it difficult to distinguish and block.

        ??? question "Can you connect to Tor via VPN?"

            Connecting to Tor through a VPN is a common practice, known as either "VPN-over-Tor" or "Tor-over-VPN," and there are differences between the two:

            1. **VPN-over-Tor**: This method involves first connecting to the Tor network and then using a VPN service through Tor. This configuration is less common as it requires the VPN provider to support connections through the Tor network, and it might not offer additional protection for your IP address.
            2. **Tor-over-VPN**: This is the more commonly used approach. You first connect to a VPN, and then connect to Tor from the VPN. This method has several advantages for enhancing privacy and security:
                  - Your original IP address is hidden behind the VPN server, preventing ISPs (Internet Service Providers) from seeing that you are using Tor.
                  - The VPN connection can help bypass blocks on Tor network entries, especially in certain countries or network environments where Tor entry nodes are blocked.

    - [x] Understand what OONI is.
    - [x] Understand what network surveillance and censorship are.
    - [x] How OONI tests operate.
    - [x] Differences in network surveillance and censorship between Taiwan and other countries.

    !!! abstract "OONI: Basic L1"

        ??? question "Understand what OONI is."

            You can start by exploring the "[What is OONI?](./what-is-ooni.md){target="_blank"}" section to gain an understanding.

        ??? question "Understand what network surveillance and censorship are."

            - **Internet Surveillance**: Refers to the monitoring and recording of users' online activities by governments, organizations, or individuals, such as emails, search history, website browsing, and communications. Surveillance often involves the use of monitoring technologies, like data packet inspection, to obtain specific internet traffic information.
            - **Internet Censorship**: Refers to the restriction or control of users' access to certain information on the internet. This can include blocking websites, filtering content, or prohibiting certain keyword searches. Censorship is often implemented by governments but can also be enacted by corporations or other organizations.

        ??? question "How OONI tests operate."

            - OONI provides a free open-source testing tool called OONI Probe, which allows users to run tests in their own network environments to detect if their network is being censored.
            - OONI Probe tests systematically send requests to various websites and services to check if the sites and services listed on the [web list](./ooni-weblists.md){target="_blank"} can be accessed normally.
            - The test results are **anonymously uploaded** to OONI's data servers and made publicly available on [OONI Explorer](https://explorer.ooni.org/){target="_blank"} for researchers and the public, facilitating a better understanding of internet freedom.

        ??? question "Differences in network surveillance and censorship between Taiwan and other countries."

            - **Taiwan**: Taiwan's internet environment is relatively free, with the government not implementing widespread internet censorship or surveillance. Users are free to browse a wide range of content on the internet, and the government places a relatively strong emphasis on protecting individual privacy rights.
            - **Other Countries**: For example, Mainland China enforces strict internet blocking and censorship policies, often referred to as the "Great Firewall," which restricts access to many foreign websites and services. Countries like North Korea impose more extreme restrictions on internet access, allowing only a very limited selection of content. Other countries, such as Russia and Iran, also engage in varying degrees of internet surveillance and website blocking.
            - You can refer to the section "[Why Internet Freedom Matters?](./internet-freedom-matter.md){target="_blank"}" for more information.

    - [x] Risks of using OONI Probe.
    - [x] How ASN Autonomous Networks work.

    !!! abstract "OONI: Basic L2"

        ??? question "Install and use OONI Probe to generate test reports."

            - **Install OONI Probe**: Download the OONI Probe application through the [OONI official website](https://ooni.org/install/){target="_blank"}.
            - **Using OONI Probe**:
                - After launching the application, you can choose the type of test you want to run, such as testing website blocking, connectivity of instant messaging apps, or interference from middleboxes.
                - Once you tap to start the test, OONI Probe will automatically perform the detection and generate results.
                - The results are uploaded to OONI's servers and displayed in your application, and you can also view more detailed reports on the OONI Explorer website.

        ??? question "Can you use OONI Probe with VPN?"

            - It is not recommended to use a VPN with OONI Probe tests, as a VPN will alter your traffic path and IP address, potentially resulting in detection of a changed network environment rather than any censorship or interference that might exist in your actual network.
            - The goal is to **test the local network** for censorship conditions, so tests should be conducted without a VPN to accurately measure the true network situation.

        ??? question "Risks of using OONI Probe."

            - Using OONI Probe for testing can attract the attention of network administrators, especially in countries with strict internet censorship. Therefore, it's important to be aware of the local internet policies and assess the potential risks of using OONI Probe.
            - During testing, OONI Probe will access various websites and services, which could trigger observation and logging by network monitoring systems.

        ??? question "How ASN Autonomous Networks work."

            - An ASN is a unique identifier used to identify an Autonomous System (AS).
            - An Autonomous System is a collection of one or more IP blocks, managed by one or more Internet Service Providers (ISPs) or large enterprise units for routing. Each AS communicates on the Internet using an ASN to facilitate the exchange of routing information and IP packets. The ASN system ensures more efficient operation of the global Internet and guarantees that traffic between different networks can reach its intended destination correctly. You can refer to the introduction in the first paragraph of "[ASNs Autonomous System Observational Data Analysis](./ooni-asns-coverage.md){target="_blank"}" for more information.
